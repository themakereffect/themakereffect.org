Information collected and processed includes the user’s IP address, network location, and geographic location. The analytics acquire all information directly from the user, by installing a cookie (see the section on Cookies, above) on your computer, if you have enabled JavaScript. The Maker Effect Foundation does not share any personal information it collects with any analytics tool provider and those providers do not collect any personal identifying information about you.
